Roole was my first deep dive into compiler architecture. I initially hand-wrote a parser, but eventually switched to using a [parsing expression grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) (PEG) parser generator for better maintainability.

It was also an early experiment in programming language design. While Roole is just a CSS preprocessing language, itâ€™s powerful enough to be Turing complete.

A notable feature is its built-in CSS auto-prefixing, predating tools like Autoprefixer.

Roole was designed with a small core and a plugin architecture -- econceptually similar to how [the unified ecosystem](https://unifiedjs.com) is structured.
