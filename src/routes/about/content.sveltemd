Hi, I'm Glen Huang, a software engineer based in Oxford, United Kingdom. I specialize in building web applications and exploring tools, technologies, and workflows that make them easier to develop, deploy, and run.

I’ve been creating websites and web apps since I was 13. Back then, IE6 still ruled the web, the shift from table-based layouts to divs and CSS was the cutting edge, and deployment meant uploading files via FTP. The web has changed dramatically since then — both frontend and backend — but my enthusiasm for building on this open platform hasn’t faded.

I also enjoy tinkering with iOS and Mac development, and managing my development environment declaratively using Nix makes me happy.

Outside of coding, I enjoy reading and writing, trying new foods, and traveling to places with rich cultures and beautiful landscapes.
